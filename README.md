# Mini Project 2 Build a Clock using JavaScript
Who does not use a clock? It would be great if you can build a clock using JavaScript. There’s a good possibility you’re on a webpage or using a web application that has a self-updating time component (like a clock), and it’s powered by JavaScript code.
